# Backend

## Purpose
Lightweight tooling for loading and validating skill definitions from `../skills`.

## Quick Start
1. Install deps (from repo root or `backend/`):
   - `npm install`
2. Run the loader:
   - `npm run backend:dev`

## Notes
- The entry point is `backend/index.ts`.
- Skills are loaded from `skills/` relative to the repository root.
