To ensure Lovable (Frontend) and Codex (Backend) work in perfect harmony, here is the official JoraFlow 4-Day Execution Pipeline.

This document uses a "Bridge-First" strategy, where the data contract is established on Day 1 so both agents can build toward a single goal.

JoraFlow: 4-Day Rapid Development Pipeline
Day 1: The Blueprint & Foundation
Primary Tool: Codex (Backend)

Objective: Define the "Source of Truth".

Tasks:

SQL Schema: Execute the migration to create applications, status_history, and sync_logs in Supabase.

The Bridge: Generate the OpenAPI Spec (openapi.yaml) that defines the inputs and outputs for the AI agents.

Auth Setup: Configure Google/Microsoft OAuth scopes in the Supabase Dashboard.

Day 2: The Face (UI/UX Implementation)
Primary Tool: Lovable (Frontend)

Objective: Build the interactive analytics engine.

Tasks:

Component Build: Create the Dashboard, Ghosting Radar, and the Sankey Diagram.

Data Mocking: Feed Lovable the openapi.yaml and the "100-line sample dataset" to populate the UI before the real backend is live.

Realtime Listeners: Implement Supabase Realtime subscriptions to listen for status_history changes.

Day 3: The Brain (Agentic Backend)
Primary Tool: Codex (Backend)

Objective: Deploy the specialized skills and parsing logic.

Tasks:

Edge Functions: Deploy the AgentOrchestrator to Supabase Edge Functions (Deno).

Parsing Agent: Implement the Gemini 3 Pro logic to extract status from raw email/metadata.

Security Guardrail: Integrate DNS validation and PII scrubbing within the ingestion pipeline.

Day 4: Integration & "The Wow Factor"
Primary Tools: Both Lovable & Codex

Objective: Final wiring and demo preparation.

Tasks:

The Swap: Replace the mock API calls in Lovable with the live supabase.functions.invoke() calls.

Polishing: Add Framer Motion animations for the recruitment funnel and "Confetti" triggers for Job Offers.

Final Demo Audit: Run a full sync of 100 varied emails to verify classification accuracy and performance.

Key Directive for Both Agents
"Do not deviate from the OpenAPI Spec or the SQL schema established on Day 1. All frontend components must be responsive and all backend functions must prioritize Zero-Trust security protocols."
